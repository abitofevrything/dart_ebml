# EBML

EBML (Extensible Binary Meta Language) is a binary container format designed as a binary equivalent to XML and specified in [RFC 8794](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8794).

This package provides support for encoding and decoding EBML Schemas and EBML Documents.

## Schema validation

This package performs minimal validation of EBML schemas and EBML documents to ensure they comply with RFC 8794, but not all aspects are checked.

I am open to contributions if anyone wishes to add these validations.
